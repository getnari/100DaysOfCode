### Day 9: Tuesday, May 29, 2018
#### Summary: Wrote ottergram book project from scratch

**Today's Progress**:

- Wrote ottergram project from my front end dev book from scratch without referencing the book
- Learned about line height on inline elements

**Thoughts**

Felt good about my work and resolved bugs through google instead of cheating.
