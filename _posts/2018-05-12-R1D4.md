### Day 4: Saturday, May 12, 2018
##### Summary: First blog, Bootstrap complete, VM research

**Today's Progress**: 

- Finished Bootstrap module of #freeCodeCamp 
- Wrote my 100DaysOfCode mission statement and project list
- Setup github pages and jekyll for blogging (needs work, this is very rudimentary)
-- To do in the future: fix hardcoded relative paths; style homepage; add an about page.
- Installed Parallels to setup VM on later
-- per this article: http://osxdaily.com/2017/04/11/run-macos-virtual-machine-easy-parallels/

**Thoughts** 

I stayed up all night working on this because I was so into it.
