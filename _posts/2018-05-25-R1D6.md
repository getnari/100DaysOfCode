### Day 6: Friday, May 25, 2018
#### Summary: Big Nerd Ranch book review

**Today's Progress**:

- Installed Atom.io text editor and packages
- Forked front-end-dev-book from github and created new branch to redo exercises
- Took notes on review of first 3 chapters of Big Nerd Ranch book

**Thoughts**

Not a lot of coding today; mostly setup and reading.
